    <h1>The Giant Squid</h1>
    <p>The <abbr title ="genus: Architeuthis">giant squid</abbr> is a deep-ocean dwelling squid in the family Architeuthidae, represented by as many as eight species. Giant squid can grow to a tremendous size <cite>see Deep-sea gigantism</cite>: recent estimates put the maximum size at <abbr title = "43 ft">13 m</abbr> for females and <abbr title = "33 ft">10 m</abbr> for males from the posterior fins to the tip of the two long <abbr title="second only to the colossal squid at an estimated 14 m/46 ft, one of the largest living organisms">tentacles</abbr>. The mantle is about 2 m (6.6 ft) long (more for females, less for males), and the length of the squid excluding its tentacles is about 5 m (16 ft). Claims of specimens measuring 20 m (66 ft) or more have not been scientifically documented.</p>
<br>
<p>On 30 September 2004, researchers from the <abbr title ="Museum of Nature and Science">NMNS</abbr> of Tokyo, Japan and the <abbr title="Ogasawara Whale Watching Association">OWA</abbr> took the first images of a live giant squid in its natural habitat. Several of the 556 photographs were released a year later. The NMNS and OWA successfully filmed a live adult giant squid for the first time on 4 December 2006.
